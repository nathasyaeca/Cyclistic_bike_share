 # Cyclistic_bike_share

This is case study about company called Cyclistic but the data is from real life dataset under the licence of `https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement`. open sources since 2013. But in this project, I'll used the data that I gather from July 2020 to October 2020. All the process from Importing, Exploration, Cleaning, Analyzed, and Visualization is created from R-Programming Language. This project primary used 4 packages which is;
* Tidyverse : That I used mainly for cleaning, analyzed, and visualization.
* Skimr : I used it for understanding the dataset better by summarizing the important point from dataset like mean, max, min, average, and sum of total data.
* Lubridate : To manipulated `datetime` data type
* Geosphere : To calculate distance between two ordinal data type.

## Primary Key
The objectivication of this project is to understand and see if there's a pattern between `casual member` and `annual member`. and by understanding it more, we can conclude something on how to convert `casual member` into `annual member`. because it's much more profitable for the company to convert already user to `annual member` rather than gather new users.
